# C++ Division by Zero Error
This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: division by zero.  The `bug.cpp` file contains code that attempts to divide by a variable that may be zero, resulting in undefined behavior and likely a program crash.

The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version of the code that includes error handling to prevent division by zero.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in C++ to avoid unexpected program termination.
